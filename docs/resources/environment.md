# sym_environment (Resource)

The `sym_environment` resource provides an Environment to deploy one or more Flows. You may use multiple Environments such as 'sandbox' and 'prod' to safely test your flows in isolation before deploying them for production usage.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sym_integration" "slack" {
  type = "slack"
  name = "prod-workspace"

  external_id = "T1234567"
}

resource "sym_runtime" "this" {
  name = "sandbox-runtime"
  label = "Sandbox Runtime"
  context_id = sym_integration.runtime_context.id
}

resource "sym_integration" "runtime_context" {
  type = "permission_context"
  name = "runtime-sandbox"

  external_id = "12345678"

  settings = {
    cloud       = "aws"
    external_id = "1478F2AD-6091-41E6-B3D2-766CA2F173CB" # optional
    region      = "us-east-1"
    role_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/sym/RuntimeConnectorRole"
  }
}

resource "sym_environment" "this" {
  name = "sandbox"

  runtime_id = sym_runtime.this.id
  integrations = {
    slack_id = sym_integration.slack.id
  }
}
```
